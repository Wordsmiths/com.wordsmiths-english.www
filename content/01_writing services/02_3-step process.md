### 3-Step Process
We have adopted a three-step editing process during which we thoroughly review your work while maintaining an active dialogue with you.

> This process will result in an improved version of your work that retains your personal or professional writing style.

The basic service is done in three steps:

Step 1
: You will submit your completed document to us and we will start proofreading it. We will send you one proofread page within 24 hours. This will help us ensure that your expectations are met and that we understand what you expect from us. 
  Once you have approved this sample, we will finish proofreading the entire document and send it to you within the agreed time frame. As most of the actual proofreading is done in this step, it is the step that needs the most time.

Step 2
: We will send the corrected document to you with our comments and questions. Please respond to the comments and questions within the timeframe we have agreed upon. Most of these questions will relate to clarifying your argument and revising any ambiguous language.

Step 3 
: Upon receiving your response, we will make the final changes to the document; working through it one last time to be sure we have addressed all issues. Within the agreed-upon timeframe, we will send you the finalized document with our corrections.
